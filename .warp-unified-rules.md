# WARP MULTITHREADED UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT RULES

## PROJECT GOAL - ALWAYS CHECK FIRST

CRITICAL: Before any development work, read the current project goal from:
File: `warp-multithreaded/masterplan-goal.md`

This file contains the live, up-to-date project goal that can be edited anytime via dashboard.
ALL development decisions must align with the current goal.

## FULLY AUTOMATED SESSION MANAGEMENT

You are working in a multi-session development environment with FULLY AUTOMATED session management.

### Auto-Session Triggers
- Frontend work: UI components, styling, React/Vue creates "frontend" session
- Backend work: APIs, database, server logic creates "backend" session  
- Testing work: Tests, specs, QA creates "testing" session
- DevOps work: Deployment, Docker, CI/CD creates "devops" session

### What Happens Automatically
The system will:
1. Analyze your request and detect work type
2. Auto-create appropriate session with correct focus
3. Configure proper directories and file boundaries
4. Prevent conflicts between parallel sessions
5. Switch sessions when work context changes

CRITICAL: NEVER manually create sessions - the system handles everything automatically.

## SESSION-SPECIFIC RULES

### Frontend Session Boundaries
YOU SHOULD HANDLE:
- UI components and user interfaces
- Styling and responsive design
- Client-side interactions and forms
- Frontend routing and navigation
- Static assets and media files

AVOID - Let Backend Handle:
- API endpoints and server routes
- Database operations and models
- Server-side authentication logic
- Business logic and data processing

### Backend Session Boundaries
YOU SHOULD HANDLE:
- API endpoints and routes
- Database models and operations
- Server-side business logic
- Authentication and authorization
- Data validation and processing

AVOID - Let Frontend Handle:
- UI components and styling
- Client-side interactions
- Frontend state management
- User interface design

### Coordination Protocol
Before touching shared files:
1. Check if other sessions are working on them
2. Coordinate changes to avoid conflicts
3. Focus on your session's specialization area
4. Communicate significant changes

## TECH STACK CONFIGURATION

Strategy: Let AI Decide (Recommended)
Guidance: AI will analyze your project requirements and choose the optimal tech stack.

AI Decision Process:
1. Analyze project goal and requirements
2. Consider performance, scalability, and development speed
3. Choose modern, well-supported technologies
4. Prefer full-stack solutions when possible
5. Optimize for developer experience and deployment ease

Common AI Recommendations:
- Full-Stack: Next.js + TypeScript + tRPC + Prisma
- SaaS Applications: Next.js + Clerk + Stripe + Vercel
- Real-time Apps: Next.js + Socket.io + Redis
- AI/ML Apps: Python + FastAPI + PostgreSQL + React

## HOSTING AND INTEGRATION SETUP

Hosting Choice: railway
Database: postgresql
Authentication: clerk
Styling: undefined

### Railway Integration - Highly Recommended
```bash
# Install and setup Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli
railway login
railway init
```

### PostgreSQL Setup
```bash
# For local development
# Install PostgreSQL locally or use cloud service
# Consider PlanetScale or Supabase for managed PostgreSQL
```

### Clerk Authentication Setup
```bash
# Install Clerk
npm install @clerk/nextjs
# Add environment variables for Clerk keys
```

## PERFORMANCE GUIDELINES

### Performance Targets
- API Response Time: 200ms
- Expected Users: 100
- Database Queries: Optimize for efficiency
- Frontend Bundle: Keep minimal and fast-loading
- Caching: Implement appropriate caching strategies

### Performance Best Practices
- Database: Use indexes, avoid N+1 queries
- API: Implement response caching where appropriate
- Frontend: Code splitting and lazy loading
- Images: Optimize and compress all media
- Monitoring: Track Core Web Vitals and API performance

## ENVIRONMENT CONFIGURATION

Operating System: Windows
Shell: PowerShell (pwsh) version 5.1.22621.5624
Current Directory: D:\warp-multithreaded\warp-multithreaded

### PowerShell Command Equivalents
Always use PowerShell-compatible commands:
- Use `Invoke-WebRequest` or `curl.exe` instead of curl
- Use `Get-Content` instead of cat
- Use `Set-Location` or `cd` for directory navigation
- Use `Get-ChildItem` or `ls` for listing files
- Use `Copy-Item` instead of cp
- Use `Move-Item` instead of mv
- Use `Remove-Item` instead of rm
- Use `New-Item` instead of touch
- Use `Select-String` instead of grep

NEVER assume Unix/Linux commands will work. Always use PowerShell-native commands.

## MASTERPLAN INTEGRATION

### Always Check Project Context
Before starting any work:
1. Read the current goal from `masterplan-goal.md`
2. Check `.warp-masterplan/` for project status
3. Review completed tasks and current priorities
4. Align your work with the masterplan specifications

### Context Files to Reference
- `masterplan-goal.md` - Current project goal (ALWAYS CHECK)
- `masterplan-config.json` - Complete project configuration
- `.warp-masterplan/masterplan.md` - Project overview
- `.warp-masterplan/tasks.json` - Active task list
- `.warp-masterplan/decisions.md` - Technical decisions

## CRITICAL COORDINATION RULES

### Framework Version Check - MANDATORY FIRST STEP
```bash
# ALWAYS run this BEFORE any work
node scripts/version-detector.js
```

IF VERSION CHECK FAILS:
- STOP immediately - do not proceed
- Framework needs updating
- Follow update instructions
- Only proceed when status shows "UP_TO_DATE"

### Session Boundaries - Auto-Enforced

Frontend Sessions Handle:
- React/Vue/Angular components (`src/components/**/*`)
- Styling and CSS (`src/styles/**/*`)
- UI interactions and forms
- Client-side routing
- Static assets (`public/**/*`)

Backend Sessions Handle:
- API endpoints (`src/api/**/*`)
- Database models (`src/models/**/*`)
- Server middleware (`src/middleware/**/*`)
- Authentication logic
- Business logic and validation

Shared Files - Coordinate First:
- `package.json` - Dependencies
- `.env` files - Environment variables
- Configuration files
- `docker-compose.yml`

## DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

### Starting Work
1. Check framework version with `node scripts/version-detector.js`
2. Read current goal from `masterplan-goal.md`
3. Describe what you want to build naturally
4. System auto-creates appropriate session
5. Start development with full context

### During Development
- Stay within auto-created session boundaries
- Reference masterplan specifications
- Follow tech stack guidelines
- Use PowerShell-compatible commands
- Test changes align with project goal

### Quality Standards
- All work must align with project goal
- Follow tech stack best practices
- Meet performance targets
- Include appropriate testing
- Document significant changes

## SPEC-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT

Your unified development environment is configured for:
- Goal-Driven Development: Always reference the current project goal
- Auto-Session Management: No manual session creation needed
- Tech Stack Consistency: Follow configured architecture
- High Performance: Meet specified performance targets
- Automated Integration: CLI tools and deployment ready

Just describe what you want to build - the system handles the rest.
