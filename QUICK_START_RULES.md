# 🚀 Quick Start: Warp Rules Activation

## The KEY: Warp Rules Control Everything! 🗝️

**Without Warp Rules**: Standard AI behavior (no framework)  
**With Warp Rules**: Multithreaded AI coordination activated!

## 📋 Copy-Paste Rule Combinations

### For Frontend Work
```
Use frontend-session-rules, multi-session-coordination, and masterplan-session-rules from my Warp Drive. [Your task here]
```

### For Backend Work  
```
Use backend-session-rules, multi-session-coordination, and masterplan-session-rules from my Warp Drive. [Your task here]
```

### For General Coordination
```
Use multi-session-coordination and masterplan-session-rules from my Warp Drive. [Your task here]
```

### For Basic Multi-Session Only
```
Use multi-session-coordination from my Warp Drive. [Your task here]
```

## 🎯 What Each Rule Does

| Rule File | Activates |
|-----------|-----------|
| `multi-session-coordination.md` | Session awareness, conflict checking, team coordination |
| `masterplan-session-rules.md` | Persistent memory, task management, project context |
| `frontend-session-rules.md` | UI/component specialization, frontend file ownership |
| `backend-session-rules.md` | API/database specialization, backend file ownership |

## ⚡ Power User Setup

### Step 1: Initialize Project
```bash
node /path/to/warp-multithreaded/scripts/coordinator.js init
node /path/to/warp-multithreaded/scripts/coordinator.js masterplan init
```

### Step 2: Open Multiple Terminals

**Terminal 1 - Frontend:**
```
Use frontend-session-rules, multi-session-coordination, and masterplan-session-rules from my Warp Drive.
Working on the user interface and components.
```

**Terminal 2 - Backend:**
```
Use backend-session-rules, multi-session-coordination, and masterplan-session-rules from my Warp Drive.
Working on APIs and database integration.
```

**Terminal 3 - General:**
```
Use multi-session-coordination and masterplan-session-rules from my Warp Drive.
Working on testing, documentation, or DevOps tasks.
```

## 🔄 Session Workflow

1. **Start with Rules**: Always begin prompts with Warp Rules
2. **Check Context**: AI will check project state and conflicts
3. **Specialized Work**: AI follows session-specific behavior
4. **Update Progress**: AI updates masterplan and logs progress
5. **Coordinate**: AI communicates with other sessions as needed

## 💡 Pro Tips

- **Always include rules** in your first message to activate the framework
- **Combine 2-3 rules** for full functionality (coordination + memory + specialization)
- **Use different rule combinations** in different terminals for parallel work
- **Rules = AI behavior change** - no rules means standard AI operation

---

**Remember: Warp Rules are the activation key that transforms standard AI into a coordinated multithreaded development team!** 🎯
